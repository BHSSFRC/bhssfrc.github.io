## This document is not...
the `git` manual. This document only covers how we structure the repository branches. If you have no idea what `git` is and how to use it, there are a plethora of finely made cheatsheets online. For example:

* [GitHub's cheat sheet.](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) Despite it suggesting you install thier `git` GUI, you should still avoid it like the plauge.
* [The DuckDuckGo cheat sheet.](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=git+cheat+sheet&t=ffab&ia=cheatsheet)
