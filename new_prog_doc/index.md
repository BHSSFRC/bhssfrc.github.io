## Getting Started
### Installing all the tools
1. Install [git.](https://git-scm.com/)
 * If you want, you can also install a [GUI interface for it.](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) As a new user, you may find [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) to be the easiest to work with. **Avoid the GitHub client like the plauge.**
2. Install the [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) for your operating system. If you don't know what that is, it's most likely Windows, 64 bit.
3. Install your Java IDE of choice. Suggestions:
 * [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)
 * [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)<br>Note: the Community Edition is fine, but you can apply for a free copy of the Ultimate edition as a student.
 * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) and [Gradle](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cazzar09.Gradle) extensions.
